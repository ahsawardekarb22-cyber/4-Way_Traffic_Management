# 4-Way_Traffic_Management

A smart, embedded solution for managing traffic at four-way intersections using Arduino and real-time logic.

Overview
This project designs an adaptive traffic control system that intelligently regulates signal timing based on traffic conditions using Arduino microcontrollers. It integrates real-world hardware interfacing and simulation for validation.

Features
Arduino-Based Signal Control: Two versions of Arduino logic (Arduino1.ino and Arduino 2.ino) for managing signal patterns and timings.

Visual Simulation: A Proteus simulation (Proteus_Simulation.png) that demonstrates signal sequencing and logic flow before hardware deployment.

Hardware Implementation: Circuit schematic (Hardware.png) illustrating real-world wiring and the signal control setup.

How It Works
Arduino reads (or simulates) input signalsâ€”such as vehicle presence or time-based triggers.
Depending on the logic, the sketch cycles through green/yellow/red signals for the four directions.
Proteus simulation validates the timing and logic before moving to hardware.
The hardware setup mirrors the simulated logic, ready for deployment.

Applications & Benefits
Pre-deployment Testing: Run logic in a simulator before applying to real-world hardware.
Cost-Effective Solution: Affordable and easy-to-modify Arduino-based system.
Modular Design: Suited for small-scale implementations, prototypes, or educational setups.

Future Improvements: Ideas like sensor integration, real-time traffic data, or adaptability for emergency vehicle priority
